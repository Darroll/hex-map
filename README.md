# Hex Map Project

This project contains the final Hex Map 27 unitypackage imported in a Unity 2021 project. It is identical to the [Hex Map tutorial series](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/hex-map/) except for the upgrade to Unity 2021. This is the starting point for the modernization of Hex Map in project form.
